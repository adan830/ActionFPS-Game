# Before contributing

**No Issue = No Discussion = No agreement = Rejected Contribution**

Discussion is very important to us, to determine whether something is important or not.

# Code quality

Where appropriate: Tests, Modularity, Decoupling.

Low code quality is a big no-no, especially given the current state of the code.

# Size of contributions

Contributions **must** be incremental. No large refactors.

This means you work slower, but at higher quality, write tests.

# One thing at a time

Don't add new features if the Issue is to refactor.

However refactoring while you're adding a new feature is fine.

But if you do refactoring thing about how to add tests to it - if appropriate and possible.

# Workflow

Anything that's priority will get a `high-priority` label. Anything that's not could be `medium priority`, `low priority`. Anything we're not ready to take on now will be *CLOSED* and tagged as `postponed`.
