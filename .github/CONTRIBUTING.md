# Before contributing

**No Issue = No Discussion = No agreement = Rejected Contribution**

Discussion is very important to us, to determine whether something is important or not.

# Code quality

Where appropriate: Tests, Modularity, Decoupling.

Low code quality is a big no-no, especially given the current state of the code.

# Size of contributions

Contributions **must** be incremental. No large refactors.

This means you work slower, but at higher quality, write tests.
